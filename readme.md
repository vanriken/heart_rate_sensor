# Heart-rate Sensor

This project uses an Arduino with the MAX32664 Biometric Sensor Hub and the MAX30101 Pulse Oximetry and Heart Rate Module. <br>
The user can interact directly with the Arduino by using a serial monitor program such as [HTERM](https://www.der-hammer.info/pages/terminal.html). <br>
In the future, it will also be possible to use a GUI program on the PC.
