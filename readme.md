# Heart-rate Sensor

This project uses an Arduino with the MAX32664 Biometric Sensor Hub and the MAX30101 Pulse Oximetry and Heart Rate Module.
The user can interact directly with the Arduino by using a serial monitor program such as [HTERM](https://www.der-hammer.info/pages/terminal.html).
In the future, it will also be possible to interact with the sensor by using a GUI on the PC.
